            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Nethmini Yasodara Jayasinha</span>, a 3rd-year student at SLIIT (BSc (Hons) in Information Technology, Specializing in Data Science). I'm passionate about data analysis, data science, machine learning, and cloud technologies.</p>
            <p>I have a strong background and hands-on experience in various fields such as data engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization. My journey includes working on diverse projects, such as building recommendation systems, predicting app ratings, and analyzing customer behavior using machine learning algorithms and models. I am skilled in programming languages such as Python and SQL and have practical knowledge of cloud platforms like AWS. I'm also passionate about using tools like TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, Power BI, and Flask to create innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>I am eager to continue expanding my skills in AI/ML and data engineering, aiming to contribute effectively to any data-centric team. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to help organizations make data-driven decisions and solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p>When I’m not working on projects, I enjoy learning new technologies, reading up on the latest trends in AI, and improving my English speaking skills.</p>
